# Shopify-App-Store-Data-Science
Data on Shopify App Stores, Ratings, and Reviews from Kaggle used to generate exploratory data analysis question, determine which figures and tables to use to answer these. 

## Objective:
The objective of this data science project is to take the data relating to the Shopify App Store and determine why certain applications are the most/least popular based on category, features, ratings, and reviews and what makes them the most/least successful. My goal from this is to develop my skills with pandas, NumPy and matplotlib by analysing the data, and creating graphs to visualize the data.
